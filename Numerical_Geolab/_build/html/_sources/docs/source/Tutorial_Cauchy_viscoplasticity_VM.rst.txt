Simple shear of a 2D Cacuhy layer with Von-Mises yield criterion and Perzyna viscoplasticity
============================================================================================

In this series of tutorials, we will validate the Cauchy, Perzyna viscoplasticity law available in Numerical Geolab. We will study three applications in order to evaluate the 
accuracy of the underlying material law and the capabilities of Numerical Geolab in applying different types of boundary conditions and materials
Finally, we will showcase the flexibility of Numerical Geolab in running parametric analyses by simple modifications in the python script.

 | The three applications we will study are the following:
  
 * Application 1: Response comparizon in simple shear of a perfectly plastic, strain rate hardening, :math:`\eta^{vp}>0`, 2D Cauchy layer under slow and fast shear strain rate.
 * Application 2: Shear relaxation of a 2D Cauchy layer, here we will apply an instantatenous bpoundary condition.
 * Application 3: Strain localization analysis for a strain softening, H<0, strain-rate hardening, :math:`\eta^{vp}>0`, material.
 
 | Each application is separately described in the documentation:

Cauchy elastoviscoplasticity in Numerical Geolab
================================================

This paragraph serves to clarify the notation used in Numerical Geolab in comparison to other availlable formulatios broadly applied 
in literature and standard finite element software. In Numerical softare the Perzyna model of viscoplasticity is applied, 
where the yield criterion for the material is given in terms of the J2 invariant of the stress tensor and the strength of the material under pure shear.
