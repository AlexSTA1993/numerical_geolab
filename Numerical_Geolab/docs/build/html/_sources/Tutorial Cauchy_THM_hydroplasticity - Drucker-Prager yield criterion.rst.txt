Cauchy THM couplings: Hydroplasticity application
=================================================

Because Hydro-plasticity involves the use of the more complex Drucker- Prager yield criterion, which introduces a 
hydromechanical coupling on th yield criterion, due to the dependence of the effective pressure :math:`p^\prime` on the pore fluid pressure :math:`P`
according to the Terzaghi principle, and a second hydromechanical coupling on the pore fluid pressure diffusion equation (see :ref:`previous tutorials<Application of Thermo- Hydro- Mechanical (THM) couplings in Numerical Geolab>`)
we will perform two different applications in order to test the effect of each coupling separately. The effects of the hydro-mechanical couplings are shown in the following tutorials.
